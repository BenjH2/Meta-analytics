# Meta-analytics

This project aims to estimate a set of meta-metrics, proposed in *Meta-Analytics: Tools for Understanding the Statistical Properties of Sports Metric*, with which to identify the most useful metrics to evaluate a sports player. The meta-metrics calculated are: 
* **Discrimination** - does the metric differentiate between players, 
* **Stability** - does the metric measure the same thing over time, and 
* **Independence** - does the metric provide new information.
